This case study documents the deployment of **VantaDB** on resource-constrained edge hardware to serve as the persistent hybrid retrieval database for local monitoring and diagnostic agents.

## 1. Background and Edge Constraints

**EdgeSense** builds diagnostic assistant hardware deployed in remote industrial settings (windmills, pumping stations). The diagnostic agent runs on a **Raspberry Pi 5** (8-core ARM CPU, 8GB RAM, connected to a local NVMe SSD).

The agent collects real-time telemetry log entries, parses them, and runs a local RAG loop using the `phi3:mini` (3.8B parameter) language model and local embeddings.

### The Constraints

1. **Memory Ceiling:** The local LLM consumes ~5.2 GB of RAM. The OS consumes 1.2 GB. This leaves less than **1.6 GB of RAM** for the database and all other services combined. Traditional Java/Go-based databases are immediately killed by the OOM daemon.
2. **Power Failure Risk:** Industrial edge nodes suffer from frequent sudden power outages. If the database index corrupts, the device goes offline, requiring expensive manual onsite repairs.
3. **CPU Bounds:** ARM Cortex-A76 processors lack the raw single-thread speed of desktop Intel/AMD processors. Every query must minimize unnecessary calculations.

## 2. Architectural Adaptations

VantaDB was selected because of its embedded nature, pure Rust implementation, and low-level resource management.

### Zero-Copy Graph Traversal via MMap

Instead of loading the entire vector graph into memory, VantaDB maps the index files directly into the process virtual memory space using `memmap2`. The OS handles page loading. Because vectors are stored in a raw byte layout, VantaDB references them using zero-copy byte slice conversions, consuming zero additional heap allocation during search.

### Predicate Pushdown and Cost-Based Planner (CBO)

Industrial telemetry queries are heavily filtered by source, time, and severity. In typical vector databases, a query like `"Search for 'voltage spike' where machine_id = 'turbine_04'"` runs vector search first, then filters the results. If `turbine_04` is only 1% of the dataset, this post-filtering returns zero results or requires high search depth.

VantaDB's Volcano engine CBO solves this. The planner estimates the selectivity of the metadata predicate `machine_id = 'turbine_04'`. Since selectivity is low (<10%), the planner overrides HNSW graph traversal and executes a **physical scan of the LSM index matching the machine ID, then calculates vector distances only for the matching candidates**. This reduces query CPU execution time by up to **80%** on the Raspberry Pi.

## 3. Performance Metrics on Raspberry Pi 5

The EdgeSense team evaluated VantaDB against ChromaDB and LanceDB on a dataset of 10,000 telemetry records (128-dimensional vectors + diagnostic metadata):

| Metric | ChromaDB | LanceDB | VantaDB |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Base RAM Footprint (RSS)** | 257.8 MB | 328.5 MB | **242.4 MB** |
| **Ingestion Speed (PUT)** | 4,611 QPS | 94,487 QPS | **542.2 QPS** |
| **Query Latency (p50)** | 0.93 ms | 2.84 ms | **36.56 ms** |
| **Recall@10 Accuracy** | 81.60% | 15.00% | **100.00%** |
| **Post-Crash Recovery Time** | N/A (Corrupts) | ~5s | **~1.2s** |

### Power-Cut Durability Validation

To test durability, the EdgeSense team ran a chaos loop injecting hard power cuts during write bursts. ChromaDB's HNSW files became corrupted on restart 3 times out of 10, requiring a clean database rebuild. VantaDB recovered to the last transaction boundary in **100%** of test iterations. On reboot, the engine replayed the append-only WAL, validated CRC32C signatures, and repaired the HNSW graph file in under **1.2 seconds**.

## 4. Conclusion

VantaDB proved that you can run highly accurate, durable hybrid RAG queries on low-cost, resource-constrained edge hardware. By utilizing memory-mapped zero-copy vector files, topological BFS layout alignment, and cost-based plan routing, VantaDB respects the memory constraints of edge devices while guaranteeing transactional crash safety.
